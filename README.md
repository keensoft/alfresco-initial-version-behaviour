# alfresco-initial-version-behaviour

This simple repo AMP is a kind of a "solution" to make things clearer for our clients. Whenever a new node is created, we make that the 1.0 version. 

##Note##
This addon is only full compatible till Alfresco 5.0.d. From Alfresco 5.1 CE, Share webapp perform itself this initial versioning on uploading new content. So this addon might produce duplicated versions on document uploading by using Share.
